# Sign Language Datasets

This repository includes TFDS data loaders for sign language datasets.

## Installation

#### From Source
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sign-language-processing/datasets.git
```

#### PyPi
Not available. Need to add automatic publication on push.

## Usage

We demonstrate a loading script for every dataset in [examples/load.ipynb](examples/load.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sign-language-processing/datasets/blob/master/examples/load.ipynb)

Our config includes the option to choose the resolution and fps, for example:

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import sign_language_datasets.datasets
from sign_language_datasets.datasets.config import SignDatasetConfig

# Loading a dataset with default configuration
aslg_pc12 = tfds.load("aslg_pc12")

# Loading a dataset with custom configuration
config = SignDatasetConfig(name="videos_and_poses256x256:12", 
                           version="3.0.0",          # Specific version
                           include_video=True,       # Download and load dataset videos
                           process_video=True,       # Process videos to tensors, or only save path to video
                           fps=12,                   # Load videos at constant, 12 fps
                           resolution=(256, 256),    # Convert videos to a constant resolution, 256x256
                           include_pose="holistic")  # Download and load Holistic pose estimation
rwth_phoenix2014_t = tfds.load(name='rwth_phoenix2014_t', builder_kwargs=dict(config=config))
```

## Data Interface

We follow the following interface wherever possible to make it easy to swap datasets.

```python
{
    "id": tfds.features.Text(),
    "signer": tfds.features.Text() | tf.int32,
    "video": tfds.features.Video(shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 3)),
    "depth_video": tfds.features.Video(shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 1)),
    "fps": tf.int32,
    "pose": {
        "data": tfds.features.Tensor(shape=(None, 1, POINTS, CHANNELS), dtype=tf.float32),
        "conf": tfds.features.Tensor(shape=(None, 1, POINTS), dtype=tf.float32)
    },
    "gloss": tfds.features.Text(),
    "text": tfds.features.Text()
}
```

## Adding a new dataset

For general instructions, see the
[TFDS guide to writing custom datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/docs/add_dataset.md).
Instructions below are specific to this repository.

Make a new folder inside `sign_language_datasets/datasets` with the same name as the dataset. As a convention, the name
of the dataset should be lowercase and words should be separated by an underscore. Example:

```sh
cd sign_language_datasets/datasets
tfds new new_dataset
```

For our purposes, creating a custom TFDS dataset means writing a new class which inherits from `tfds.core.GeneratorBasedBuilder`.
If you use `tfds new` to create a new dataset then the dataset class is stored in a file with the exact
same name as the dataset, i.e. `new_dataset.py`. `new_dataset.py` must contain a line similar to:

```python
class NewDataset(tfds.core.GeneratorBasedBuilder):
```

### Registering a new dataset

The mechanism to add a custom dataset to TFDS' dataset registry is to import the class `NewDataset`. For this reason the folder
`sign_language_datasets/datasets/new_dataset` must have an `__init__.py` file that imports the class
`NewDataset`:

```python
from .new_dataset import NewDataset
```

Even though the name of the class is `NewDataset`, it will be available for loading in lowercase and uppercase characters
are interpreted as the start of a new word that should be separated with an underscore. This means that the class can
be loaded as follows:

```python
ds = tfds.load('new_dataset')
```

### Generating checksums

The folder for the new dataset should contain a file `checksums.tsv` with checksums for every file in the dataset. This
allows the TFDS download manager to check the integrity of the data it downloads. Use the `tfds build` tool to generate
the checksum file:

```sh
tfds build --register_checksums new_dataset.py
```

Use a dataset configuration which includes all files (e.g. does include the video files if any) using the `--config`
argument. The default behaviour is to build all configurations which might be redundant.

## Why not Huggingface Datasets?
Huggingface datasets do not work well with videos.
From the lack of native support of the video type, to lack of support of arbitrary tensors.
Furthermore, they currently have memory leaks that prevent from saving even the smallest of video datasets.
